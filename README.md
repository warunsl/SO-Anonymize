SO-Anonymize
============

Many a times when I answer questions on Stack Overflow sites, I tend to get biased towards an answer from a person with more Stack Overflow points. I needed a way to go through the answers and comments objectively.

This is a Chrome extension that I created for myself that strips out user information from Stack Overflow sites from the questions pages.
